# Giancarlos Portfolio — Starter

A clean, responsive, no‑framework portfolio for a Software Engineer. Built with semantic HTML, modern CSS (custom properties, responsive grid), and a small sprinkle of JS (theme toggle, filters, reveal).

## Quick start
1. Edit **index.html**:
   - Update name, summary, email, and links (GitHub, LinkedIn).
   - Replace project links and descriptions.
   - Swap in your real résumé at `assets/resume.pdf`.
2. Open `index.html` locally to preview.
3. Deploy:
   - **GitHub Pages**: push to a repo, enable Pages → branch `main` → `/` root.
   - **Netlify**: drag‑and‑drop this folder onto the Netlify app.
   - **Vercel**: import the repo and deploy.

## Notes
- Accessible by default (skip link, focus styles, reduced‑motion friendly).
- Dark/light theme with localStorage persistence.
- No external JS/CSS dependencies. Icons are inline SVG.
